# CSE331:Algorithm Complexity - Network Topology Optimization

## This project optimized the paths and ways packets of data were sent over a network topology in order to maximize profit

This project was a collaborative effort for CSE331, and was the final project in which we needed to design an algorithm that would distribute packets of data from servers to clients in the most efficient and optimized way for the given network topology.


The clients would have many variables attached to them, including how much they were paying for internet, their location relative to servers, how likely they were to drop if they recieved poor service, how likely they were to sue, and many other variables. Our task was to design a modified dijkstra's graph theory algorithm, which would heuristically distribute packets and find the most optimized path for packets based on all of the variables and constraints presented in order to maximize the amount of profit.
